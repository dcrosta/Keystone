Congratulations!
================

That's it! You're now a web programmer! This may not be the most impressive
web application ever designed, but, hey, everyone's got to start somewhere.
The important thing is that you now have a grasp of some of the fundamental
concepts and tools with which to build more complex web applications that do
more interesting things.


What's Next?

Keysotne uses Python for server-side code, so if you are new to Python, you
should `learn Python <http://www.learnpython.org/>`. If you're already
familiar with Python, you can move on to :doc:`/advanced`.
