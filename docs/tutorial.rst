Learn Web Programming with Keystone
===================================

Keystone is, by design, incredibly easy to work with. This tutorial will
walk you through setting up Keystone for local development, teach you the
basics of Python web development and, by example, of HTML, and end with you
deploying your first application to a free web hosting service.

This tutorial is designed for those unfamiliar with web programming
concepts. If you've worked with web programming frameworks before, you may
be interested in :doc:`quickstart`, which only covers what's different about
Keystone.
